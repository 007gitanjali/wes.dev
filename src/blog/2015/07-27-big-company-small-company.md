What is the difference between a local startup with less than 20 employees to an international conglomerate spread across over 60 countries? Which one is better?

In ~10 years developing for the web, I've seen my share of radically different companies. From TV stations to payment gateways, from a couple of client-side developers to hundreds of people committing on the same repository. It has been a wild ride, and it gave me insights that I want to share here today.

# Communication, politics and respect

One aspect of my life that changed radically as I worked for bigger companies was the importance of good communication. When you are working for a small company, you are much closer to your colleagues, and it's much easier to find them. As the size of the company increases, the amount of teams is larger and, therefore, communication becomes critical.

Let's say there's a critical error in a specific page. In a small company, the entire process can be verbal: someone shouts the problem, you shout the progress. In a bigger company, there are alarms, e-mails, finding the responsible team, continuously giving feedback until the problem is solved, and then more e-mails about the reasons, fixes and preventive measures so it doesn't happen again.

And, because you don't always know who is in the other side of those channels -- or worse: it's an e-mail list --, you have to be very careful on how to proceed. In my experience, it is always good to be as direct as possible, including enough details when needed, so that your message is clear.

Good communication doesn't rely only on being brief and explicit, but also on listening, understanding and respecting your fellow developers, designers and any other audience you might be talking to. It goes without saying that building trusted relationships and [making people happy](/cool-things-make-people-happy/) helps your image, and that is very important if you have to interact with different teams.

Smaller companies have a lot of space for arrogance, sometimes you are the only responsible for a feature, and you actually know everything about it, so you are the go-to person for that, and have authority to change it. In a bigger environment that is not always possible. Being arrogant means dismissing previously acquired knowledge, and leads to the repetition of past errors, loss in your colleagues' trust, and even contributes to a hostile workplace.
