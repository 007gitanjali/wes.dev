In this beginning of 2015 I commemorated the eight month of my arrival in Amsterdam. I was found by a [Booking.com](workingatbooking.com) recruiter on May of the previous year, and after three interviews, 33 hours in an airplane and the usual bureaucracy, immigrated in the Netherlands with a permanent contract.

I had **never** thought that I would be living in Amsterdam. If you know me, you're well aware where my heart is.

Now, eight months later, I already go everywhere on [my bike](http://instagram.com/p/re84GAmtcd/)¹, fell miserably by getting both wheels on the tram track, smoked *tolerated* pot², saw a day with [16 hours of sunlight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice), had a barbecue on [Vondelpark](https://www.google.com/maps/@52.3572862,4.8861256,358a,20y,279.78h,70.01t/data=!3m1!1e3), took [a](http://instagram.com/p/wrf21KGtdc/) [lot](http://instagram.com/p/wqV0xZmteG/) [of](http://instagram.com/p/onM0IxGtWE/) [incredibly](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205027328467876) [beautiful](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205188949588303) [pictures](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205678822794827), went on a road trip to [Munich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich) and [Cologne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne), et cetera.

# The Good

Amsterdam is beautiful. It is a huge metropolitan city, with small and very tight historically preserved buildings, it feels cozy with nearby services &ndash; [the same market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Heijn) every 2 blocks &ndash; but still full of big brand stores, tourists and life everywhere.

I was biking to work when it hit me that I really liked living here. It was a good weather, I was cycling peacefully, the landscape was gorgeous. There's nowhere else in the world that combines all of this.

# The Bad

The biggest challenge from people that come from hotter areas is the winter. It's cold, it rains, and there are 80 Km/h winds, sometimes all together because fuck you.

Customer service is also a pain point for most people. Here it's normal to spend a lot of money on a 0900 customer call, only to get a condescending "sorry, I cannot help you at all".

# The Ugly













¹ Of course if the temperature is above 10˚C, I'm not fully Dutch yet.  
² Nothing is really legal in the Netherlands, just tolerated.
