I work with software development since 2006 &ndash; dude, almost 10 years! &ndash; and I’ve been through a lot of different ways of managing a project. At college I’ve read about waterfall, RUP, and endless strategies and paradigms full of bureaucracy, impediments and managers over managers, where your product would take years to form, only to be already *outdated*.

All my work life, though, was centered on the web, and its fast-pacing evolution. I’ve always used agile methodologies like Scrum, where you maximize your speed by reducing planning, approving, endless talks, while acting faster on smaller tasks and having a *deliverable*.

Recently, with the absolute rise of the startup model, where people throw huge amounts of money into companies that may fly or die, there is an old concept gaining infinite traction: the Minimum Viable Product.

The problem is this is, most of the times, **bullshit**.

# What is a MVP?

<cite>In product development, the minimum viable product (MVP) is the product with the highest return on investment versus risk. &ndash;Wikipedia</cite>

In other words, an MVP is just a calculated risk: you invest the least amount possible into something that will, in the end, give your money back. Of course that’s not guaranteed, nor an exact science.

Suppose you are building the car from the very-popular-printed-and-pinned-everywhere-on-the-office-so-motivational picture above. Your managers will gather around and say "we want a car".

# The simplification

In a traditional software development method, you would go to your team, create a business plan, a schedule, a set of milestones for your car &ndash; the wheel, chassis, body, then the car, as shown in the image &ndash;, all of that with the amount of people and money required.

Obviously, the chance that all this happens as planned *is zero* <sup>[citation needed]</sup>, and you would be very late with a potentially terrible car.

With the MVP, you would say “let’s figure out something smaller that we can invest on, build know-how, and still profit”, and in a very crazy world, that will be the skateboard.

# Building knowledge and advancing

The following steps would all aggregate knowledge and experience for your company and team, you will learn to fail, what is the strongest solution and what can scale and what cannot. At the end, after *pivoting* a lot, your company would eventually make a car.

But by know you might already get why this is a weird scenario. I’m not just criticizing the idea behind this famous-lets-spread-it-to-our-teams-woohoo image, but the whole concept that this is an acceptable methodology.

# Bullshit!
