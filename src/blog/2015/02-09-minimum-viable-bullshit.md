I work with software development since 2006 &ndash; dude, almost 10 years! &ndash; and I’ve been through a lot of different ways of managing a project. At college I’ve read about waterfall, RUP, and endless strategies and paradigms full of bureaucracy, impediments and managers over managers, where your product would take years to form, only to be already *outdated*.

All my work life, though, was centered on the web, and its fast-pacing evolution. I’ve always used agile methodologies like Scrum, where you maximize your speed by reducing planning and endless talks, while acting faster on smaller *deliverables*.

Recently, with the absolute rise of the startup model, where people throw huge amounts of money into companies that may fly or die, there is an old concept gaining infinite traction: the *Minimum Viable Product*.

The problem is this is, most of the times, **bullshit**.

# What is a MVP?

<cite>In product development, the minimum viable product (MVP) is the product with the highest return on investment versus risk. &ndash;Wikipedia</cite>

In other words, an MVP is just a calculated risk: you invest the least amount possible into something that will, in the end, give your money back. Of course that’s not guaranteed, nor an exact science.

Suppose you are building the car from the very-popular-printed-and-pinned-everywhere-on-the-office-so-motivational picture above. Your managers will gather around and say "we want a car".

# The simplification

In a traditional software development method, you would go to your team, create a business plan, a schedule, a set of milestones for your car &ndash; the wheel, chassis, body, then the car, as shown in the image &ndash;, all of that with the amount of people and money required.

Obviously, the chance that all this happens as planned *is zero* <sup>[citation needed]</sup>, and you would be very late with a potentially terrible car.

With the MVP, you would say “let’s figure out something smaller that we can invest on, build know-how, and still profit”, and in a very crazy world, that will be the skateboard.

# Building knowledge and advancing

The next steps would all aggregate knowledge and experience for your company and team, you will learn to fail, what is the strongest solution and what can scale and what cannot. At the end, after *pivoting* a lot, your company would eventually make a car.

By know you might already get why this is a weird scenario. I’m not just criticizing the idea behind this famous-lets-spread-it-to-our-teams-woohoo image, but the whole concept that this is an acceptable methodology.

# Bullshit!

The real meaning of the modern MVP is *a working prototype version of our project that will have the least amount of features our end product will have*.

Nowadays what people would do according to the image is build a skateboard, add a steering bar to it, add a seat, add an engine, enclose it in a good looking body, and call it a car.

Therefore your MVP is actually the base of your project, it will define which technology you’ll be using for a long time and the culture of your team, which are extremely important things if you want your company to thrive.

You do not want to build your success on top of a flaky solution that only tries to resolve its own problems, like Microsoft Windows. You want something solid that can help you grow organically like Unix on Mac OS X.

# Be smart

What pisses me off is that people use the MVP as an excuse to do the skateboard-turned-into-car story. The final product will be a patchwork of code and business logic, and the more the company grows, the more impossible the code becomes to work with.

In the end you still can have a working prototype version of your end product, but *you need to invest time into adapting it to a realistic solution*, otherwise, if you become successful and need to scale, your code will be bad and your developers unhappy.

A conversation about code quality, guidelines and code review is important and I will be posting about this in the future. But in the meantime, please **don’t use the MVP excuse to create a terrible codebase**.
